This configuration item is used to enable and set up the theme's comment system.

## use

```yaml
use: waline  # values: waline | gitalk | twikoo
```
To configure which comment system to use, the theme currently comes with Waline, Gitalk, and Twikoo built-in. You can also use another one.

## Waline

Waline is a comment system with a backend, derived from Valine. You can consider Waline to be Valine with a backend. It is more secure, fast, concise, and open source compared to Valine. You can find more information at the following websites: https://github.com/walinejs/waline and https://waline.js.org/. If you want to use Waline in the Redefine theme, please see the following information.

To use in Redefine Theme:


### LeanCloud Setup (Database)

1. [Login](https://console.leancloud.app/login) or [register](https://console.leancloud.app/register) for LeanCloud International Edition and enter the [Control Panel](https://console.leancloud.app/apps).
2. Click on the top left corner to create an app and name it something you like (choose the free development version):

![Create App](https://evan.beee.top/img/leancloud-1.f7a36b20.png)

3. Enter the app and select `Settings` > `App Key` from the bottom left corner. You will see your `APP ID`, `APP Key`, and `Master Key`. Please record them for later use.

![](https://evan.beee.top/img/leancloud-2.4cc69975.png)

:::caution Domestic version(china mainland version) requires recordal access

If you are using the domestic version of Leancloud ([leancloud.cn](https://leancloud.cn/)) we recommend switching to the international version ([leancloud.app](https://leancloud.app/)). Otherwise, you will need to bind an additional **recordal** domain name to the app, and purchase a standalone IP and complete recordal access:

- Log in to the domestic version and enter the app you want to use.
- Select Settings > Domain Binding > API Access Domain > Bind New Domain > Enter Domain > Confirm.
- Follow the instructions on the page to complete the CNAME resolution on DNS.
- Purchase a standalone IP and submit a work order to complete recordal access. (The current price of a standalone IP is Ôø• 50/each/month)

### Vercel Deployment (Server-side)


[![Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwalinejs%2Fwaline%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fexample)

1. Click the button above to go to Vercel for server-side deployment.

:::tip

Note: If you are not logged in, Vercel will ask you to register or log in. Please use your GitHub account for quick login.

:::

2. Enter a Vercel project name that you like and click 'Create' to continue:

![Create Project](https://evan.beee.top/img/vercel-1.4e9dd7aa.png)

3. Vercel will then help you create and initialize a new repository based on the Waline template, with the repository name being the project name you entered earlier.

![deploy](https://evan.beee.top/img/vercel-3.0918fcee.png)

A few minutes later, a full screen of fireworks will celebrate your successful deployment. At this point, you can click 'Go to Dashboard' to jump to the app's control panel.

![deploy](https://evan.beee.top/img/vercel-4.f7f4c12b.png)

4. Click on the top 'Settings' - 'Environment Variables' to enter the environment variable configuration page, and configure three environment variables 'LEAN_ID', 'LEAN_KEY', and 'LEAN_MASTER_KEY'. Their values correspond to the 'APP ID', 'APP KEY', and 'Master Key' obtained in the previous step in LeanCloud.

   ![Set Environment Variables](https://evan.beee.top/img/vercel-5.3a5de7f0.png)

   Note:

   If you are using the domestic version of LeanCloud, please also configure the 'LEAN_SERVER' environment variable with the value of the bound domain name.

5. After the environment variables are configured, click on the top 'Deployments' and click the 'Redeploy' button on the right side of the topmost deployment. This step is to make the set environment variables effective.

![redeploy](https://evan.beee.top/img/vercel-6.c1af01b1.png)

6. This will take you to the 'Overview' screen to start deployment. After a while, the 'STATUS' will change to 'Ready'. At this point, please click 'Visit' to jump to the deployed website address, which is the 'Vercel URL' on the 'Overview' page.

7. Now you can use your website and enjoy Waline. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/walinejs/waline/issues/new) or [email us](mailto:i@evanliu2968.com).

      #### Bind Domain (Optional)

      If you do not want to use the domain name provided by vercel, you can bind your own domain name.

      1. Click 'Settings' - 'Domains' at the top to enter the domain name configuration page.

      2. Enter the domain name you want to bind and click 'Add'.

      ![Add domain](https://evan.beee.top/img/vercel-8.49378bd3.png)

      3. Add a new 'CNAME' record in the domain server provider.

      | Type  | Name    | Value                |
      | ----- | ------- | -------------------- |
      | CNAME | example | cname.vercel-dns.com |

      4. Wait for it to take effect, and you can access it through your domain name üéâ

      - Comment system: example.yourdomain.com
      - Comment management: example.yourdomain.com/ui

``` js
exports.main = require('twikoo-func').main
```
8. After creating, click "twikoo" to enter the function details page, then click the "Function Code" tab. Click "File - New File" and enter `package.json`, then press Enter.

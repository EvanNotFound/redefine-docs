```yaml
fontawesome: # select fontawesome versions you want to use, in order to reduce the loading time, select as few as possible
   thin: false # use fontawesome thin version or not
   light: false # use fontawesome light version or not
   duotone: false # use fontawesome duotone version or not
   sharp_solid: false # use fontawesome sharp-solid version or not
```

The `Fontawesome Pro v6.2.1` version is included in Redefine theme, you can enable the following icon series:

- `fa-thin` [Thin icon series](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&f=thin)
- `fa-light` [Light icon series](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&f=light)
- `fa-duotone` [Duotone icon series](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&f=duotone)
- `fa-sharp fa-solid` [Sharp Solid icon series](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&f=sharp)

However, it's recommended to only enable necessary icon groups from these series to improve the access speed. On the other hand, the `solid`, `regular`, and `brands` icon groups are enabled by default to ensure that all icons are available.

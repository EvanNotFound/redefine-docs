# style

`style` This configuration item is used to configure the basic style of the website.

## primary_color

Set website theme color, support **rgb**, **rgba**, **hexadecimal** and other color formats, for example: `rgb(0, 102, 204)`, `rgba(0, 102, 204, 0.8)`, `#0066cc`. [Web Safe Colors](https://www.bootcss.com/p/websafecolors/) is recommended.

## avatar

Set the author's avatar, which will be displayed on the article content page, as shown in the figure below.
![avatar](https://evan.beee.top/img/Screen%20Shot%202022-12-11%20at%205.44.13%20PM.png)
You can use **the relative path of the local image** (that is, the image stored in the `redefine/source/images/` path) or **the external link URL of the image**.

Writing reference:

- local pictures

   ```yaml
   avatar: /images/avatar.svg
   ```

- Picture external link

   ```yaml
   avatar: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvanNotFound/hexo-theme-redefine/main/source/images/avatar.svg
   ```

## favicon

To set the website favicon icon, you can use **relative path of local image** (that is, the image stored in `redefine/source/images/` path) or **image external link URL**.

## og_image

[Open Graph Image](https://ogp.me/)

This option means that when sharing links on social platforms, since most peopleâ€™s blogs have not been backed up, the icon will not be displayed, and the look and feel is very bad

It is better to turn off `og_image` display directly.

-  `enable` decides whether to enable it or not
- `image_url` is the link to the image

## article\_img_align

Set the image arrangement position of the article content page, the default `center`, optional: `left` (left), `center` (centered).

## right_side_width

Sets the **width** of the right **TOC** module. Normally, you don't need to modify it. If you need to set it, please keep the unit as `px`.

## content\_max\_width

Sets the maximum width of the content area. Normally, you don't need to modify it. If you need to set it, please keep the unit as `px`.

```yml
nav_color:
   left: "#f78736" #left side
   right: "#367df7" #rightside
   transparency: 35 #percent (10-99)
```

This is the gradient background setting for the navbar.

`left` corresponds to the color on the left

`right` corresponds to the color on the right

`transparency` is the background transparency of the navigation bar, please use a number between `10-99`

# lazyload

````yaml
lazyload:
   enable: false
````

This configuration item is used to enable lazy loading of images.

When enabled, all images will not be loaded when the page is opened, and the corresponding image resources will only be loaded when the window scrolls to the image position.

::: tip
When there are too many pictures, turn on the lazy loading function, which can effectively improve the page loading speed!

If you upgrade the Redefine theme, the value of `version` in the theme configuration file `/node_modules/hexo-theme-redefine/_config.yml` must be consistent with the version number of `_config.redefine.yml`! !

For example: I upgrade the theme to version 0.2.0, then the value of `version` in the theme configuration file `/node_modules/hexo-theme-redefine/_config.yml` must be 0.2.0 . If you use smooth upgrade, you need to manually change the version number in `_config.redefine.yml`.
